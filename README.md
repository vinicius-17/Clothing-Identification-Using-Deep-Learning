# Clothing-Identification-Using-Deep-Learning
Clothing Identification Using Deep Learning Fashion MNIST is a standard dataset used in Deep Learning and Computer Vision, containing 70,000 images from 10 different classes.  Despite bringing pre-processed images, it represents a good challenge to apply deep neural networks. Specifically, it serves to demonstrate a special type of neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNN).  The dataset is divided between training (60,000 samples) and testing (10,000 samples), with each image having dimensions of 28 x 28 pixels.
